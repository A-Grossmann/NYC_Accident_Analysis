2.) What are the causes of most accidents? Can the contributing factors for the vehicles be classified?

	The top 5 sources/causes of the accidents include:
		1.) Driver Inattention/Distraction
		2.) Following Too Closely
		3.) Failure to Yield Right−of−Way
		4.) Passing or Lane Usage Improper
		5.) Backing Unsafely

	When put into 5 classification groups the top 5 order causes was:
		1.)Driving Mannurism (Following too closely, Speeding, Passing without blinker...)
		2.)Distraction (Texting, eating,...)
		3.)Condition/Illness (poor sight, medical emergency...)
		4.)Bad Road Conditions (potholes, raining/weather, road debre...)
		5.)Malfunctions (bad breaks, bad lights...)
	
	It is obvious that disraction is the biggest cause of accidents even though it may not be the deadliest.
	Driving Mannurisms as a classification overall cause the most accidents.  I wonder
	if this is true in other cities than NYC?	 


3.) What time of day do the accidents occur and where?
	Its no suprise that the histogram shows that most traffic accidents occur between the hours of 
	7am - 11am and 2pm - 8pm (rush hour). Peaking around 2pm -5pm

4.) When did the Alcohol envolvment happen?
	The time of day that it is shown that Alcohol envolment rises from 6pm peaking at midnight thn tapers
	off untill 6am as seen on the histogram

5.) What types of cars were most envolved in the accidents?
	The accidents with the highest on average severity for those envolved were:
	1.) Illness
	2.) Unsafe Speed
	3.) Alcohol Involvement
	4.) Obstruction/Debris
	5.) Passanger Distraction
	
	When using the 5 classifications for the different common factors we get the
	severity is rated like the following:
	1.) Person of Illness
	2.) Malfunctions
	3.) Driving Mannurisms
 	4.) Distraction
	5.) Bad Road Conditions
